      Hi there ðŸ‘‹!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm Oussama, a passionate Ruby on Rails developer with over a decade of experience in crafting
      robust web applications. My journey began with a fascination for elegant code and scalable architectures,
      and has evolved into a relentless pursuit of excellence in software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been deeply immersed in the Rails ecosystem from its early iterations, witnessing its growth
      and evolution firsthand. Throughout my career, I have contributed to a diverse range of projects,
      from startups to enterprise-level applications, consistently leveraging best practices and emerging
      technologies to deliver high-quality and efficient solutions.
